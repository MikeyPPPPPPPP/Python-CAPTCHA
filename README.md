# This is a CAPTCHA made with the python module PIL

## This is for a website I'm making so I dont have to worrie about bots.


## How to solve it?



there are 3 horizontal lines that have four charectors each, you need to combine the lines to make one big line.  The key is printed the same way you read a book.

```
The code is a mess so i'll rewrite it with classes and add more cherectors.
