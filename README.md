# This is a CAPTCHA made with the python module PIL

## This is for a website I'm making so I dont have to worrie about bots.


## How to solve it?

The key is printed the same way you read a book.
There are 3 horizontal lines that have four charectors each, you need to combine the lines to make one big line. 

```
The code is a mess so i'll rewrite it with classes and add more character. Right now
it's very bear minimum because I wanted to make what was in my head out as fast as possible
but there will be improvments with minipulating the text so its harder to read.
